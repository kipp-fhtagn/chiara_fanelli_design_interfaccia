                Hello. 
                <br/> <br/>
                
                Chiara Fanelli here, <b>ISIA Urbino</b> student for the bachelor degree, class 2019. <br/>
                This page let you navigate through my <b>Interface design I</b> class. <br/> 
                
                In the first days, we tried to get confident with interfaces, surfing through the web and focusing on the interfaces with which we were already familiar.<br/><br/>
                
                We started a <a href="visual_analysis.html" class="clip" >visual analysis of web components</a>.<br/>
                This helped us to begin a conversation about the bad and good practices and about the UX (User Experience).<br/><br/>
                
                In the next days, for the second assignment, we had to <a href="revisit_graphic_reference.html" class="clip">revisit a graphic reference</a>,
                in my case a flyer for an event.<br/><br/> 
                
                Third thing we had an <a href="INSERT_LINK_HERE" class="clip">HTML workshop</a> to play with basic shapes, colors, divs and other weird nerd monsters of brackets.<br/><br/> 
                
                Last but not least, for our final assignment we had to design a <a href="INSERT_LINK_HERE" class="clip">complete website</a> and we had to chose a theme.
                
                <br/><br/>
                Enjoy
